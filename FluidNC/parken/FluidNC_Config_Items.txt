Names and Units

All config item names should include a suffix that describes the units or type. Examples...

    step_pin: All pins should have _pin as the suffix
    pulse_us: All values of time shall include the unit like _ms or _us
    max_travel_mm All values of length shall be specified in millimeters.
    r_sense_ohms
    run_amps Run current in amps

Default values

Most keys have default values. For pins this is usually NO_PIN. If you are not using a pin like an enable on a spindle, you do not have to specify it in your YAML file. If you do a $CD (config dump) you will see all the keys, even if you did not specify them in your YAML file.
